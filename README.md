# Pulse with EVOX

<br>EVOX is a relatively recent framework for scalable evolutionary computation. Frameworks like these are extremely underrated, especially when their engineering design is intelligent and sufficiently abstracted for different purposes.<br />
<br>Evolutionary computation is extremely broad both in terms of theory and applications. Much like other areas of AI, it will only explode once GPU acceleration (through JAX or any other framework) becomes ubiquitous in the field.<br />
<br>The objective of this project is to eventually implement my algorithms and build the same testing structure as in my [thesis](https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/145483/1/TCDMAA2413.pdf)/[paper](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-29573-7).<br />
